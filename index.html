                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, working at the intersection of single-cell proteomics, neurobiology, and data science. With dual expertise in wet-lab and computational biology, I translate multi-omics data into clinically actionable insights. My work spans AI, ML, digital health, and translational neuroscience.</p>

            <h3>Full Biography</h3>
            <p>My scientific journey has been built on a rare intersection — <strong>wet lab experimentation</strong> and <strong>dry lab computation</strong> — a fusion that allows me to not only generate complex biological data, but to truly understand it. I’m Dr. Deeptarup Biswas, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Neurology, <strong>Boston Children’s Hospital | Harvard Medical School</strong>, where I develop high-throughput workflows for <strong>Single-Cell Omics</strong>, integrating mass spectrometry, machine learning, and neurobiology to unlock insights into brain disorders at an unprecedented resolution.</p>
            <p>I began at the bench: from culturing cells to running targeted proteomics assays, handling multiple mass spectrometers, and refining sample preparation protocols. These hands-on wet lab skills laid a strong foundation, but I knew the story of biology could not be told by experiments alone. I immersed myself in <strong>data science, AI, and big data analytics</strong>, building algorithms and pipelines that translated raw omics signals into <strong>clinically relevant knowledge</strong>.</p>
            <p>During my Ph.D. at <strong>IIT Bombay</strong>, I explored the proteomic signatures of <strong>Meningioma Brain Tumors</strong>, resulting in high-impact publications, patents, and the <strong>Dr. Gargi Vishnoi Memorial Prize for Best Ph.D. Thesis</strong>. My passion for translational science deepened through this work, bridging biomolecular insights with potential diagnostics and therapeutic directions.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I’ve balanced <strong>discovery-driven science</strong> with <strong>real-world healthcare applications</strong>. My contributions during the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong> to national diagnostic research projects earned institutional recognition, and I’ve actively worked on biomarker panels for <strong>grade-specific diagnosis of Meningioma</strong>, pushing forward the cause of <strong>precision medicine in neurology</strong>.</p>
            <p>I’ve also been fortunate to lead and co-develop innovative digital tools — <strong>BrainProt</strong> (India’s first brain disease omics database), <strong>CoVProt</strong>, <strong>IBPM</strong>, <strong>PhosphoMap</strong>, <strong>Clustome</strong>, and others — designed to democratize complex data for researchers, clinicians, and public health experts.</p>
            <p>Equally important is my commitment to <strong>Digital Health and Education</strong>. Under the mentorship of <strong>Prof. Sanjeeva Srivastava</strong>, I served as a <strong>Teaching Assistant at KCDH (Koita Centre for Digital Health)</strong>, where I helped train and mentor <strong>30+ B.Tech and M.Tech students</strong> in applying AI/ML to real-world healthcare problems. From ideation to analysis, I guided student-led projects across proteomics, genomics, wearable tech, and electronic health records, nurturing the next generation of <strong>data-driven healthcare innovators</strong>.</p>
            <p>Whether analyzing a single cell or leading a full-scale digital health project, my goal remains consistent: to advance <strong>translational neuroscience</strong> by bridging <strong>multi-omics data</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, and <strong>clinical knowledge</strong> — turning complex biology into <strong>meaningful, patient-centered solutions</strong>.</p>
